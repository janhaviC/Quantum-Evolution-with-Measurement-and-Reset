# Extending Method 1 to multi qubit

We here have attached the notebooks to show that are solution proposed at section1 can be extended to multi qubit.
We successfully ran that on Aria-1 and found the fidelity to be of 0.9

If we are running it for U with m qubits we need m + 1 qubits to get the results. We ran the simulation for m=10 and n=1500 using AWS-SV1.
